## Section 1: What is Cloud Computing?  

### 1.1 Traditional IT Overview 

Client <-> Network <-> Server 

Packets are routed from client to server through the network and sent to the correct server and client thanks to their IP addresses.  

__A server contains__: 
- Compute: CPU 
- Memory: RAM 
- Storage: Data 
- Database: store data in a structured way 
- Network: Routers, switch, DNS server 

**Network**: cables, routers and servers connected with each other. 

**Router**: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet.  

**Switch**: Takes a packet and sends it to the correct server/client on your network
